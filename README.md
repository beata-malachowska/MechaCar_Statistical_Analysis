## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
[!lm model](https://github.com/beata-malachowska/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/screenshoot_lm.png)

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Variables with p<0.05: Vehicle_length and ground_clearence

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Yes, because p value for whole model is 5.35e-11. Intercept p value is also significant 5.08e-08.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 Yes, because R2 equals 0.7149 meaning it explains 71% of mpg variance.
